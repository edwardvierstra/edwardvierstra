    <h1>Ed's Wonderful Website!</h1>
    <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. You have found the place to download and play games I made.</p>
    <h2>$0 Budget News - 3/15/25</h2>
    <p>Minecraft Bedrock Edition is sadly discontinued for MacOS, starting this month. Due to the version of the game being made primarily for Windows in C++, Mojang will not give access to MacOS users, with the only way being the unofficial Linux launcher (https://mcpelauncher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html).</p>
    <p>-</p>
    <p>The XP bar is being replaced with the Player Locator bar, which shows your friends unless they crouch or wear a mob or pumpkin head.</p>
